# BIS631-Advanced-Techniques-in-Causal-Inference-Final-Project-MDR
This is the simulatoin study of Marginalized Doubly Robust (MDR) I proposed for tackling the large action space by combining the good properties of DR and MIPS.
I compare MDR with DM, IPS, DR, and MIPS in terms of MSE, bias and variance.

ope.py and policy.py are the helper functions

Please check MDR_BIS631_Final_Project_Tatsuhiro_Shimizu.ipynb for the simluation study
